0.06
 - Yet another go at not reloading files.
 - Make error messages on unloadable files somewhat less verbose.

0.05
 - Try harder to avoid reloading the code being documented.
 - Make doc maps actually work.

0.04
 - Add force_permissions option (with documentation but not test, yet, fixme).

0.03
 - Make Moose test much less specific.  (Should fix FAILs from test
   reporters.)
 - Add use warnings/strict to the pm files under t/, to quiet
   Test::Kwalitee.

0.02
 - Version bump because of a stupid error uploading to PAUSE... the kind of 
   stupid error that you can't just fix and reupload, because PAUSE doesn't
   let you overwrite files.   

0.01
 - First version
